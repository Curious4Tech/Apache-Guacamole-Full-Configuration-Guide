# Apache Guacamole Server Setup Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step setup for creating users and connecting both Windows and Linux servers to your Apache Guacamole server, enabling remote access via a web browser.

## Prerequisites

- An installed and running Apache Guacamole server.
- SSH access to the Guacamole server.
- Administrator access to the target Windows and Linux servers.
- Proper network configuration (firewalls, etc.) allowing connections on required ports.

## Step 1: Access Guacamole and Create Admin User

1. **Log in to the Guacamole Web Interface:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to your Guacamole server‚Äôs IP or domain.
   - Example: `http://<Guacamole_Server_IP>/guacamole`

2. **Log in as Admin:**
   - Default username is **`guacadmin`** with the password set during installation.
   - **Tip:** Change this default password after initial login for security.

## Step 2: Configure Connections in Guacamole

### A. Adding a Windows Server 2022 Connection

1. **Prepare the Windows Server 2022:**
   - Ensure **Remote Desktop (RDP)** is enabled on the Windows server.
   - Open port **3389** in firewall settings for RDP connections.

2. **Add the Windows Connection in Guacamole:**

But before that, we‚Äôll create a new group, as these groups will help organize the connections: **`Settings > Connection > New Group`**


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d7b4dc2-9844-449d-85db-8c4c5565233d)


In this example, I‚Äôm creating a group named **`Servers`**. It will be placed under the **`ROOT`**  location, which is the root of the hierarchy. The group type **`Organizational`** should be selected for all groups intended to organize connections. Click on **`Save`** to create the group.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83356e35-7ab7-4666-8f1b-f944f7fcf8d5)


   - Go to the new group you created, expand it and then click on **`New Conncetion``**.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9580ac91-6ffc-4f90-bddc-fafcb409b675)


   - **Name**: Enter a recognizable name (`Windows-Server`).
   - **Location**: Choose the group you previously created.
   - **Protocol** to **RDP** and complete these fields.

     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/811002e3-705f-4c99-8066-481a1ce0b235)


   - **Hostname**: Enter the IP or hostname of the Windows server.
   - **Port**: Default is **3389**.
   - **Username and Password**: Enter Windows server credentials.
   - **Domain** : Enter your name here (Optional).
   - **Security Mode**: Set to **NLA** or **RDP** as required (Optional).
   - **Ignore the server certificate** : check it.

   - **Performance**: Check your preferred ones.

   - Save the connection: Scroll down a little bit and then click  on **`Save`**

     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f0de78d-3e24-41fe-8705-e2a187308be8)


You can also configure **time zone** and **keyboard layout** depending your location and language.
 Our server is now added and ready to be connected or used

3. **Test the Connection:**
   - **Log out** from your Guacamole admin account, then log in using the newly created Guacamole user credentials (in this example, `TechLearner`).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be2d7392-b093-4967-a8f6-c7c8fd10767f)

   - After logging back in with your user account, click on the server name or screen to begin managing it in the Guacamole interface.

### B. Adding a Linux Server Connection

1. **Prepare the Linux Server:**
   - Ensure **SSH** is enabled on the Linux server.
   - Open port **22** in firewall settings for SSH access.

2. **Add the Linux Connection in Guacamole:**

   - Re-log with your Guacamole admin account
   - Go to **Settings > Connections**.
   - Expand your connection group and then click on **New Connection**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd5af8cd-1e58-4f0e-80d5-bfdc42dbfe6c)

  - **Protocol** to **SSH** and complete these fields:
  - **Name**: Enter a recognizable name, it doesn't have to be your hostname but it will be better if you use it directly. (e.g., ‚ÄúLinux-Server‚Äù).

 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed20cd9-6c31-4b30-828e-94d898c4d7ac)


 - **Hostname**: Enter the IP or hostname of the Linux server.
 - **Port**: Default is **22**.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5059714-44b0-4866-b8e0-2c5350fdcdc9)

- Save the connection: Nothing to be change, we are good to go for this demo.

3. **Test the Connection:**
   - On the Guacamole dashboard, select the Linux connection and verify successful connection. It will prompt you to provide your username and password. Provide your user's  crendentials to authenticate.
   - **Logon as :** Provide your username


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e920aaa0-a7e2-49e7-9488-7d7fa4bf6a8c)


   - **Password:** Provide your  password
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/427a2acb-84da-468f-b46d-ae090aad5c5d)


  -  Now you can securely and easily manage your linux server through Guacamole.

## Step 3: Configure User Access to Connections

1. **Assign Connections to Specific Users:**
   - Go to **Settings > Users**.
   - Click on the user to assign connections.
   - Under **Connections**, check the boxes for the Windows and Linux connections you want the user to access.
   - Save the changes.

2. **Verify User Access:**
   - Log in as the newly created user and confirm they can only access assigned connections.

---

## Step 4: Adjust Security and Optional Settings

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** if required (Guacamole supports various 2FA options).
2. **Restrict IP Access** to limit access to Guacamole.
3. **Configure User Groups** for managing multiple users and connections.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure network allows necessary ports (3389 for RDP, 22 for SSH).
- **Permissions**: Verify user permissions for each connection in Guacamole.
- **Firewall Rules**: Confirm firewall rules on both Guacamole and target servers.

---

## Conclusion

Once everything is set up, users will be able to remotely access their assigned servers via the Guacamole web interface.

Happy connecting! üñ•Ô∏èüîí
